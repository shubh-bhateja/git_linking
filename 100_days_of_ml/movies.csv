3592,13192,Moonwalker,"Moonwalker is a 1988 American experimental anthology musical film starring Michael Jackson.

The movie's introduction is a type of music video for Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror"" but is not the official video for the song. The film then expresses a montage of Michael's career, which leads into a parody of his Bad video titled ""Badder"", followed by sections ""Speed Demon"" and ""Leave Me Alone"".
